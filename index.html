							</div>
							<p>My first interaction with the blue light system was through a tour of Dartmouth College. Our tour guide motioned towards what they referred to as “q-tip looking lights,” and explained that these lights were meant to call campus security and local police if you were being followed or harassed in order to reduce physical and sexual assaults on college campuses. Since then, every college campus I’ve visited has had this system in place. Admittedly, within my last 3 years of college, I have very rarely noticed or thought about these lights. Perhaps I am lucky I’ve never been in a situation where I’ve needed the lights (though I have been catcalled, yelled at, and in other dangerous situations). However, with all that I know of sexual assault from proximity and statistics, random sexual assaults are the least likely form of assault; 93% of sexual assault survivors knew their assailants beforehand (“Perpetrators of Sexual Violence”). Despite this truth, nearly all universities in the country employ blue lights on their campuses (Reaves, 2015). This creates the question: Are these blue emergency light systems then actually only means for student safety, or is there a deeper agenda at play?  I maintain there is an alternative intention; blue emergency lights are a measure of surveillance to increase the perceived safety of students through the exile, policing, and surveillance of Black and brown people.</p>
							<p>In order to assess the role of blue emergency lights, their history must be taken into account. The lights were designed and instituted in response to the Clery Act and the call for colleges to prioritize and publicize campus safety. Jeanne Clery was a 19-year-old student at Lehigh University who was murdered in her dorm room. The Clery act, or the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, was instituted in 1990 through the work and advocacy of her parents after they realized they lacked information on the physical health and safety of their daughter’s campus (“About”). The Clery Act, in part, requires colleges to report data and annual reports on crime reporting, security, law enforcement presence, sexual assault, and the prevention and response to assault (“Summary of the Clery Act”). In response to the Clery act, universities around the country began to install blue light emergency systems, starting with the University of Illinois at Chicago (Jackson). These lights were designed and installed through the urgency and mandate of the Clery Act and the push for colleges to report and practice campus safety.</p>
							<p>Although blue emergency lights may seem like a pure path to campus safety, they are more deeply political than they appear. It is known that technology is an objective and passive force in power and oppression. As Winner declares in his article, “Do Artifacts Have Politics?,” “[there is an] ongoing social process in which scientific knowledge, technological invention, and corporate profit reinforce each other in deeply entrenched patterns, patterns that bear the unmistakable stamp of political and economic power,” (Winner 23). In the introduction to Captivating Technology, Ruha Benjamin discusses “technocorrections,” where technology is used to correct both individuals and societal issues (Benjamin, “Captivating Technology,” 1-2). These corrections, however, are embedded with social biases through a phenomenon Benjamin refers to as “discriminatory design” (5). Even if blue lights were designed with the goal of correcting sexual assault, where might they also harbor oppressive features?</p>
							<p>Who and what practices are present in the room as the technology is being designed is a key indicator of what oppressive features it will carry. From exploring the current leadership team of Code Blue, the company that currently designs and sells these emergency lights, we can imagine what voices, ideologies, and people are present and excluded from the design process. The executive team as listed on the Code Blue website is entirely white and, if not actually all white, white-passing from my point of reference. The six members of the executive team have experience in technology, finances, sales, marketing, or manufacturing, but, from what I gather from what is provided in the website, little else. Furthermore, the CEO, David Cook, worked within the “United States Navy as an intelligence specialist holding top-secret security clearance” (“About Us”). The CEO’s experience leads us to question what role an intelligence specialist could have in designing what should only be security lights. Furthermore, where are the critical and non-white voices in the leadership of this company? The absence and exclusion of people of color, as well as the inclusion of military leadership, suggests the strong possibility for oversights as well as intentioned exclusion of affected voices; this moves the suspicions in the author’s mind away from safety and inclusion and one towards surveillance.</p>
							<p>We can draw parallels between Code Blue and Google in their exclusion of racialized people. In another of Ruha Benjamin’s works, Race After Technology, a tweet is cited and discussed that states: “Then Google Maps was like, ‘turn right on Malcolm Ten Boulevard’ and I knew there were no black engineers working there (Benjamin, “Race after Technology,” 144-145). Benjamin explores this seemingly small error as a larger issue of exclusion and technological gentrification that erases and writes over Black history and people. By lacking Black and brown people in the executive team of Code Blue, there is no trustworthy voice to advocate on behalf of these populations. Those who are on the team likely have no reference or experience of what would cause harm for Black and brown people nor are lower-level staff kept critically accountable by the most powerful voices in their company.</p>
							<p>However, I suspect the danger of these blue emergency lights lie deeper than just the exclusion of Blackness and brownness from the company; these lights exist to make college campuses uninhabitable and dangerous to Black and brown people. The blue emergency lights are connected to both campus and local police services, both of which are sources of violence for the aforementioned population. If there is such ready contact to police all over college campuses, these campuses, therefore, are an unsafe and potentially deadly location for those who are Black and brown.</p>
							<p>There is an argument that could be voiced which states the lights are only useful when dialed by either a student, staff, faculty member, or unaffiliated person on campus. This argument has multiple flaws. Firstly, the lights are a physical reminder of the proximity, trust / reliance, and power of the police state on campus. This creates a strongly unwelcoming environment for anyone who may be perceived as a threat due to their race and class. Secondly, the student population is an active participant in this system. College campuses are overwhelmingly white and wealthy (Bustamante). When these lights are activated, what are they activated for? In a Code Blue article, it is explained that “[m]any people think the only time to use blue light phones is when they need to report a suspicious individual, fire or health emergencies,” (Zuidema). A suspicious-- not harmful or actively violent-- is the first item on the list of possible emergencies. In an environment where most people are white, who is considered suspicious? By creating physical reminders of policing as well as using the white student body as a means of surveillance, blue lights on college campuses are means of barring and policing Black and brown.</p>
							<p>In an interesting way, blue emergency light can be compared to the lantern laws of the colonial United States. Simone Browne brilliantly exposes lantern laws as a means of hypervisibility and the surveillance of Black people within her article “Everybody’s Got a Little Light Under the Sun.” Lanterns laws mandated Black people to carry lanterns from dusk to dawn to ensure they were always visible and could be easily surveilled. She coins the term “Black luminosity” to explain the permanent illumination of the Black body and the “[subjection of] some to a high visibility” in order to “render the subject outside of the category of the human, unvisible” (Browne). The blue emergency lights similarly illuminate, both physically and symbolically. They act as a bright, constant reminder of the violence of racialization, the prison-industrial complex, and the surveillance of the state on behalf of universities, police, and white individuals (or those with proximity or investment in whiteness). They create a distinction of what belongs-- white individuals regardless of their affiliation to the university-- and what is “other” or, as Browne would say, unvisible-- Black and brown people.</p>
							<p>Whiteness is deeply invested and dependent on racialization. There is power and profit in prisons, the War on Drugs, gentrification, and surveillance. How much does Code Blue make off of the blue emergency lights as surveillance measures? How are colleges better funded, recognized, and ranked when they can ensure the “safety” of students by barring and marking Black and brown people? How are the white students who experienced increased comfort in this isolation involved or happy complacent in this process? Without a doubt, there are possible measures to protect students from sexual and physical harassment that do not contribute to surveillance. What if the money spent on designing and implementing blue emergency lights was redistributed towards more just and functional projects, such as comprehensive community walking apps or the abolition of Greek life? We must listen to those most deeply affected. Black, brown, poor students, survivors, and community members in areas with colleges and universities know best about how these systems harm them and have been calling for solutions for decades; any one of their solutions, if seriously carried out, would do more for campus safety than tools such as the blue light system. If we want to protect our communities, we must be deeply honest and critical about the technology that surrounds us, regardless of how innocent it may seem. We can and will create a future where our safety does not depend on surveillance but on building and harnessing community with those around us.</p>

							<p>Four stars line the middle of Chicago’s flag, each representing a moment in history that shaped the city. One of these stars recounts the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, a tragic event which famously decimated infrastructure and killed hundreds. One might then wonder why Chicago would want to remember such an incident, but ask any city native and you will quickly understand. In the aftermath of the Fire, Chicago rebuilt from the ground up, going on to host the World's Columbian Exposition just 22 years later. This transformation stands as a testament to the city’s resilience and the rapid technological advancement that occurred in just two decades. This period of growth is still visible in the city today - the foundation of the Chicago L was established during this time. The L, short for “elevated” which refers to the fact that most of the trains in the system run above ground, started as a group of private train lines servicing the city until coming into public acquisition in the mid twentieth century. From one train line traveling from 39th and State Street to Congress Parkway and Wabash Avenue, the L has grown into a network reaching an average weekday ridership of 759,866 in 2016. This growth has been integral in shaping Chicago as we know it - often in ways which we overlook.</p>
							<p>Given the circumstances under which the L was first built, it is evident that this technology came about due to a societal need. The population influx that followed the city’s rise from its ashes demanded a rapid transport system for the development of efficient urban life. This relationship between societal needs and technological development is cause for much debate when attempting to identify which element preceded the other; this debate fractures into two camps. The L is a strong counterpoint to technological determinism, the idea that technology develops in a bubble independent of societal impact and then goes on to shape how the future will function (Winner 19). The establishment of the L is more indicative of the opposing theory to technological determinism, namely the social determinism of technology. This theory takes into account the social and economic circumstances that influence the technology that comes about, such as the Fire which gave rise to L.</p>
							<p>Urban life and national economic shifts would further shape the future of the L. The public acquisition of the L by the CTA (Chicago Transit Authority) in 1947 was a direct result of the invention of the automobile as well as white flight following the Second World War. The former event reduced the need for public transport while the latter describes white migration to the suburbs throughout the 50s and 60s. This urban sprawl caused the private sector to operate trains at a loss which required a public acquisition in order for the city to continue to operate.</p>
							<p>The development of the suburbs also gave rise to another CTA-adjacent railroad, the Metra. This trainline, established in 1984, serves the commuter population coming into Chicago from the greater suburbs. A comparison of the L with the Metra further reveals the role economic status plays into technological development. While it is not surprising that the Metra would offer a more spacious and comfortable riding experience than the L given that the former was founded over a century later, the difference in sticker price between the two railroads is indicative of the consumer base. A single ride ticket on the Metra ranges from four to nine dollars, while a ride on the L is two dollars and fifty cents, including free transfers. While the difference isn’t astronomical, it is enough to reflect that the suburban commuters riding the Metra can afford the extra cost, given that they are the white-collar descendants of the white flight era - it is in this manner that the result of redlining continues to be seen, in a literal sense, at Union Station each morning.</p>
							<p>Public transport is tied to the politics and demographics of Chicago - it reinforces class division by easing the process of urban sprawl, allowing for wealthy suburbanites to settle farther from downtown’s financial business district and leaving economically devastated communities without access to mobility. A proposal to extend the L’s Red Line further south had been on the city’s ballot for decades before earning funding earlier this year. The extension will finally provide new opportunities for the disinvested industrial sector of the city.</p>
							<p>These kinds of legislative actions are a necessary aspect to the development of technology; without these measures people are at the liberty of the developers who are free to govern without a mandate (Benjamin 53). The L extension follows in the same vein as the Americans with Disabilities Act passed in 1990 which required the L to accommodate people with disabilities, thereby giving another previously invisible population access to mobility. The ADA was another overdue, imperfect piece of legislation - only half of all CTA stations are deemed accessible which still puts the CTA in compliance with the ADA. However, the ADA as well as the recent extension of the L discussed earlier are reflections of the ongoing work that needs to be done in order to ensure that technology is utilized to uplift the most disenfranchised people in a community, rather than working against them. In a society that idolizes innovation by immortalizing a city’s rise from literal ashes on its flag, it is important to ask who is it that we leave behind when the only direction we look is forward. A city that was expected to be forgotten rapidly rebuilt through a process of active technological advancement; it is only through active attention to and consideration of the social implications of technology that we can progress as a just society.</p>

								The Lucy Parsons Labs have demonstrated that the Chicago Police Department has access to IMSI catchers or “cell site simulators”. The best description of this technology is as follows:
							“Cell site simulators are devices that mimic cell towers and can collect data from phones, including text messages, internet browsing history, location tracking and phone call content, according to the lawsuit. When police deploy a cell site simulator, also referred to as "Stingrays" based on the name of a popular model, the device captures data from any phone in its range — not just the intended target. When the device is in use, it drains cell phone batteries and can lead to dropped calls. The devices can reach cellphones more than a mile away from them and capture data from up to 60,000 phones simultaneously.” (Cherney, 2017)
							</p>
							<p>
								This description comes from a 2017 Chicago Tribune article which recounts how Jerry Boyle, a lawyer, realized his phone was tapped while he was participating in a Black Lives Matter protest on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Unfortunately, the details of the case are not yet public. However, his suit against the CPD allows us to peer more intensely at this technology and investigate its politics and how it functions to deepen preexisting social hierarchies and dynamics, not only in Chicago, but in the United States government more broadly.
							<p>
							First patented in 2003 by Rohde & Schwarz, IMSI “stingray” catchers pose as local cell-towers in order to extract information from nearby cell-phones. They can do so indiscriminately from a large number of phones at once, and the only tell-tale sign from the phone user’s perspective might be a brief drop in service or data. This technology can be used to trace and track individuals within a given radius, and because it takes in information en masse, it can be used to build databases. Their usage in neighborhoods and densely populated areas in general means that for large-scale events like protests, demonstrators are easy targets. The Black Lives Matter protest on MLK day in 2017 is a daunting example of how exercising the right to peaceful protest can become a data grab opportunity for law enforcement, in which those who attend, or those who are simply in the area (maybe on their way to work) could get unknowingly tracked. IMSI trackers are also not court-regulated, and can be used without a judge’s warrant.
							</p>
							<p>
								When we consider “Stingray” technology, we can imagine that its design, in its purest form and divorced, for a moment, from the social hierarchies we’ll later delve into, was most likely intended to help eradicate crime. When used in remote locations, it would be effective in linking suspects to other known or unknown associates in the vicinity of any organized crime to help root out unwanted activity at the source. For example, in a drug cartel warehouse in a remote location, a Stingray would be useful in doing a sweep to ensure that anyone who physically escaped a bust could be tracked and found later. In a society that is rife with extensive networks of highly organized crime in which it is difficult to track criminals, Stingrays are undoubtedly useful.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, its use on MLK protestors demonstrates that Stingrays can also be used to serve institutional prejudices against the marginalized, and further the invisible power of the police. While it is a nice sentiment that technology is apolitical, it is usually untrue. Langdon Winner demonstrates for the reader that, even the construction of a simple overpass is a political act, with political consequences, because it reflects the politics of its creator. Because technology and its products aren’t inseparable from social hierarchies in any way, shape, or form, stingrays exist within and further the “carceral continuum,” in which the prison-industrial complex extends outside of “prison walls” and into ostensibly ordinary daily institutions like “hospitals, schools, banks, social service agencies, humanitarian organizations, shopping malls, and the digital service economy,” (Benjamin, Captivating Technology, 2019).
							</p>
							<p>
								In Ruha Benjamin’s introduction to Captivating Technology, she writes about how “individuals, families, and communities” are often “caught in the crosshairs” of the carceral continuum (2019, p.2). We need to rightfully acknowledge that the people most often caught in the crosshairs have always been and will continue to be predominantly the working class, people of color, and activists. When considering the history of racism and oppression at work in the United States, it makes more sense to assume that the innocents and justice-seekers “caught in the crosshairs” of the carceral continuum aren’t “caught” at all. They’re intentionally targeted.
							</p>
							<p>
								While Stingrays could, in theory, be used to help advance a noble form of restorative justice that corrects the wrongs of oppressive systems, history has often demonstrated that U.S. institutions have a pattern of using technology to advance corrupt interests and strengthen oppressive institutions. The Chicago Police Department and its stingray usage is only one example of how history, oppression, and technology work in tandem. Chicago, in particular, has a long and nauseating history with racial discrimination that bears significant weight on the present power dynamics between Black people and the police. Racism and redlining were engineered to segregate the citizenry. Economic opportunities and top quality education is reserved for wealthier, whiter citizens, while Black people living in Chicago neighborhoods get excluded from the wealth they generate, in the form of low wages, “unskilled” labor, and lack of upward mobility. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen how this has translated to higher death and infection rates. The CPD, and the national police force at large, seem to have only ever functioned to monitor, control, and punish Black communities.
							</p>
							<p>
								It would be remiss, therefore, to omit that CPD sits within a larger framework of U.S. federal oppression and racism. From the 1950s to the 1980s, the FBI ran a counterintelligence program (CoIntelPro) that specifically and disproportionately targeted Black empowerment groups and leftist groups working towards social advancement (Medsger, 2014). The FBI used created extensive network of surveillance and paranoia, only possible through technological advancement, and it furthered a White supremacist agenda that aimed to stamp out movements and groups working towards liberation of the oppressed. When the legacy of these institutions, which are ostensibly supposed to protect and defend the nation, is considered, it becomes obvious how twisted that mandate has become.
							</p>
							<p>
								Stingray technology, after all, is capable of capturing information from over 60,000 phones at once. If the Chicago Police Department wanted a tool with more precision, then they would buy or demand one. Hapless citizens find themselves under fire, and unfortunately, it’s no accident. As the FBI worked in the 1950s to surveille and sabotage Black empowerment groups, CPD now uses stingrays to surveille anyone and everyone who may pose a threat to their domination and legitimacy. The fact that a Stingray was used at a MLK day demonstration in a country where CoIntelPro existed not more than 60 years prior should come as no surprise.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can conclude that “Stingray” technology won’t be divorced from preexisting hierarchies and power dynamics. Instead, it will only serve to enhance the extent to which specific populations are targeted, policed, and surveilled and continue to privilege White, wealthy Americans (Benjamin, 2019, p. 115). While stingray technology was most likely designed with good intentions, to make the world safer, its usage will reproduce and reinforce harmful social control. Racism, the carceral continuum, and stingray technology will all work towards a common goal: wealthy, White supremacist institutional dominance over the marginalized, the working class, people of color, and anyone who dares to attempt to upend the current social order. As long as these systems are in place and working as designed, we’ll continue to see a world in which Stingray technology spells more trouble for the innocent than the guilty.
